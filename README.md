# ting-bill-split
Split your Ting bills based on usage or each line.

## Summary
Ting provides cellular service in the United States using Sprint and T-Mobile networks - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ting_Inc.)

Many families will put all their lines on the same plan to share savings, but Ting's billing system doesn't provide guidance on how to proportionately split monthly bills based on each line's usage. The basic solution is to split the total cost each month by number of lines evenly. For the rest of the line owners, one line streaming music all the time would negate the savings of their frugal data usage.

With `ting-bill-split`, the plan owner can use the Ting-provided `*.csv` each month to split the bill more intelligently. Shared costs are split evenly between all lines, and the usage-based costs are split proportionately.
